# Fuzzy Logic DSL with OOP Features

This project implements a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Fuzzy Logic operations with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features. It allows users to create and evaluate simulated fuzzy logic gates using variables, scopes, classes, and inheritance.

## Features

- Basic fuzzy set operations (Union, Intersection, Complement)
- Alpha-cut operation
- Variable assignment and scoping
- Class definitions with inheritance
- Method invocation with dynamic dispatch

## Prerequisites

- Scala 3.3.4
- sbt 1.9.7 or later

## Installation

1. IntelliJ
   
2. Scala



## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute:

test.scala


## Project Structure

- `src/main/scala/main.scala`: Contains the main DSL implementation
- `src/test/scala/test.scala`: Contains the test suite
